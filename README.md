Using Spiking Neuron Models 
=============================

Create an event-driven spiking map based on the leaky integrate and fire neural model

# Prerequisites
By now, you should have learnt what an event is and how to read and write events in bottles, (e.g. in the  [Optical Flow](https://github.com/vvv-school/tutorial_event-driven-flow) tutorial). You will also need some information on:

### vtsHelper

Timestamps are stored with (at the moment) 24 bits (unsigned integer) and the clock performing timestamps has a period of 80 nanoseconds.
If we do the maths we will overflow every: 2^24 * 80e-9 = 1.34217728 seconds. Therefore our code needs to handle overflows ("timestamp wraps").

##### You'll need this for your assignments!: 
As we often only need relative time between events, we can account for wraps using:

```javascript
event<> v; //allocated somewhere

int currenttimestamp = v->getStamp();
int previoustimestamp;    //allocated previously
if(previoustimstamp > currenttimestamp) //assuming events are in chronological order this indicates a wrap
    previoustimestamp -= vtsHelper::getMaxStamp();
int dt = currenttimestamp - previoustimestamp;
```

Alternatively the vtsHelper can be used to convert timestamps to a  long unsigned int (many years before an overflow):

```javascript
vtsHelper unwrap;
event<> v;
unsigned long int unwrappedstamp = unwrap(v->getStamp());
```

##### NOTE: We don't send the unwrapped timestamps in bottles so every module needs to track its own unwrapped timestamp

# Assignment
We want you to modify the Callback function (OnRead()) to 

1. Correctly handle event packets using the event library
1. Create an activity map where each point is a neuron that integrates the activity of the corresponding input pixel for each incoming event. 
1. Implement a model of **integrate and fire neuron**: its energy increases for each input event and decays exponentially over time. When the energy exceeds a given threshold, the neuron emits an event and is reset.
1. Create an output bottle of events generated by the neurons in the map (each event has x,y,t,p,ch information).
1. Send the bottle to yarp.

You should be able to visualise the subthreshold activity map of the neurons as an image stream in yarpview and the output events from the map by using `vFramer`, running the _yarpmanager script_ provided from within [**app/scripts**](./app/scripts/)

We can implement a simple integrate and fire equation as:
```
E = Ee^(-dt/Tau) + I
```
where E is the neuron enery and I is the energy injection amount: for this assignment I should be a constant (e.g. 1.0).

The structure of the application should look like:

You will run this assignment with the [_Dataset_event-spiking-model_]() dataset. The regions where a lot of events sum over time will produce output events.

Some of the points reported above have been already addressed in the code, so you need to **fill in the missing gaps** highlighted by the comment `// FILL IN THE CODE`.

Your spiking model should be coded and the parameters of decay (Tau) and spike threshold (Te) tuned such that output spikes only occur when the stimulus shakes quickly in the image (see the reference image). The model should not spike at other times.

Once done, you can test your code **Automatically**: [running the script **test.sh**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-run-smoke-tests.md) in the **smoke-test** directory.
